# User-Ad-Click-Prediction
# Advertising Data Analysis

This repository contains a Python data analysis project focused on exploring an advertising dataset. It demonstrates data loading, inspection, statistical summary, and visualization of key features.

## Overview

The dataset `advertising.csv` contains 1000 entries with features related to users' activity and demographics and whether they clicked on an advertisement. The features include:

- Daily Time Spent on Site
- Age
- Area Income
- Daily Internet Usage
- Ad Topic Line
- City
- Male (binary gender indicator)
- Country
- Timestamp
- Clicked on Ad (target variable)

## Project Goals

- Load and inspect the advertising dataset.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and relationships.
- Visualize important attributes such as user age and income.
- Analyze the target variable `Clicked on Ad` for potential prediction modeling.


## Dataset Inspection ##

- Viewing the first rows to understand the data structure.
- Using `info()` to check data types and completeness.
- Using `describe()` to obtain summary statistics.


## Data Visualization ##

- A histogram to show distribution of `Age`.
  

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- (Optional: Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab for interactive execution)

## Usage

Clone the repository and open the notebook or script. Ensure that the `advertising.csv` dataset is placed in the correct path (`/content/advertising.csv` or adjust accordingly). Run the cells or script to reproduce the analysis and plots.

This project aims to provide a foundational exploratory analysis to assist with further modeling or insights in online advertising behavior.
